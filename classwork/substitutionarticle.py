WASHINGTON — Something most Americans are NOT thankful for on this Thanksgiving week is the state of the country's political discourse, with 86 percent of the public having a negative view of it, according to a new NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll. And 58 percent of Americans who say they celebrate Thanksgiving are dreading talking about politics at their Thanksgiving dinner, the survey also finds. (Pass the potatoes but not the politics…)

So how divided is this nation? Just listen to the voices from our recent NBC/WSJ “Trump Counties” poll, which interviewed Americans from the counties that fueled President Trump’s victory a year ago. Thirty-two percent of respondents in this poll said the country was better off since Trump became president, and here’s a sampling of what these people told our pollsters:

"Our economy is better and our stock market is way up. He speaks his mind." — A white Republican man from Ohio.
"I think that Barack Obama led from behind. His policies were far to the left. He stirred up racial division. I think that Donald Trump has tackled many issues. He's done away with over 800 regulations. He's tackled some of the hard issues. Immigration, tax reform. Barack Obama divided the country racially and economically." — Another white Republican man from Ohio.
"I believe the stock market is the highest it's been in decades, less illegal aliens coming across the border. The unemployment is low." — A white Republican woman from Florida.
"Because we have a leader that is on our side and not against America. That covers a lot. That's it. He is for the good of the people of America. He is putting America first. I haven't seen it yet. I don't know. I don't know. It all works together. I trust him and think he is doing a good job. He is putting America first and I can feel it. He is not like the last president we had." — A white Republican woman from Michigan.
"I do not care for immigrants. They should go back to their own country and get approved before they come in." — A white Republican man from Indiana.
'"I feel like there is more of an emphasis on a Christian world view by our president. It's being anti-abortion, or I guess you could say pro-life" — Another white Republican man from Indiana.
By contrast, 41 percent of the respondents in these “Trump Counties” said they were worse off since Trump became president. A sampling of their voices:

"I think we are at risk of war. That is the main thing. Racial issues. There is a lot of fighting, a lot of disagreements. Not being tolerant of blacks." — A white Republican woman from Ohio.
“I’ll say for sure racial tensions have gotten worse.” — An African-American Democratic woman from Pennsylvania.
“He has a difficulty with the truth; he only cares about himself.” — A white Democratic man from Florida.
“We’re more separated, and there is more hate.” — A white Democratic woman from Wisconsin.
“Two reasons. One, that his demeanor encourages hatefulness in our country. He just tweets too much and his tweets causes problems. We could go on with that one. Two, I think we are worse off because we have so many problems and Congress will not work together." — A white independent woman from Florida.
"I just feel like since he has come into the presidency our country has become, everyone is so much more negative. Anyone can just say whatever on Twitter. There is no dignity left in the office." — A white independent woman from Indiana.
The divide is stark: Trump supporters cite the stock market, Obama, and Christian values, while his opponents talk about racial animosity, the tweets and the risk of war.
